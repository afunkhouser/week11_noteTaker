## Description
Create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.


## Installation
Run 'npm i' in the command line to install all the necessary dependencies.


## Usage
Navigate to "https://radiant-refuge-90528.herokuapp.com/" to see the live application. Click "get started" and you will be navigated to a web page that allows you to write new notes and also see past notes that have been written. On the right column you can write the title and description of your note and then click save in the upper left hand corner. The note is then displayed in the left hand column and you may click on it to view it at any time. Click on the writing tool in the upper right hand corner to begin writing a new note at any time. If you have completed a specific note, or it is now irrelevant you can click the garbage can to the right of the note and delete it.
